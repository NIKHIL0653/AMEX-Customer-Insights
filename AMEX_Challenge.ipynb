        "\n",
        "This project involves analyzing the provided American Express dataset to derive actionable insights related to customer behavior and offer effectiveness. The goal is to leverage data analysis techniques to answer specific business questions posed in the American Express Campus Challenge. The analysis focuses on understanding customer interactions with offers and identifying key drivers of engagement and spending patterns. This project addresses a real-world business problem for American Express by providing data-driven insights to optimize their offer strategies and improve customer engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technologies Used\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Python\n",
        "*   pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)\n",
        "*   numpy (for numerical operations)\n",
        "*   re (for regular expressions, if needed)\n",

        "## Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "To run this analysis, you will need to have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Clone the repository:\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   git clone <repository_url>\n",
        "   cd <repository_name>\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "2. Install the required libraries:\n",
